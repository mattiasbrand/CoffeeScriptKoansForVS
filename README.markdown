# CoffeeScript Koans for Visual Studio 2010 - learn CoffeeScript in your favorite IDE #

This project is merely an adaption of the CoffeeScript Koans from [sleepyfox](https://github.com/sleepyfox/coffeescript-koans) to make it easier to get started coding CoffeeScript in Visual Studio 2010. Since I practice DRY I encourage you to go and read his README on how to proceed with the Koans. In this document I'll only mention the steps neccessary to get started in VS 2010.
